# ITESM - Hackathon 2022;

This repo is a prototype for a web application.

The app allows users to keep track
of their vital signs and activity, to easily monitor and improve their
condition and help the treatment of chronic illness; via the suggestion
of activities based on users with similar conditions, and relating past actions
to effects on the user's vitals.
